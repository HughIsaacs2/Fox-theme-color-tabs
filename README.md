# Fox-theme-color-tabs
Adds [meta theme-color](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#meta-theme-color) support to Firefox in the form of changing the active tab color.

WARNING: This extension is currently incompatible with any themes you may have installed as it constantly changes the underlying theme. In the future I plan on fixing this problem, but that fix may be limited.

Also this extension supports changing the theme-color dynamically with JavaScript (just like Chrome for Android).
