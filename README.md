# Fox-theme-color-tabs
Adds meta theme-color support to Firefox in the form of changing the active tab color.

WARNING: This extension is currently incompatible with any themes you may have installed as it constantly changes the underlying theme. In the future I plan on fixing this problem, but that fix may be limited.
